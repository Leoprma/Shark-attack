This project aim is to study how fatal sharks are and how the attack dangerousness varied with some caracteristics, such as the sex and age of the victim or the condition of the attack (if the shark was or not provoked, for instance). Besides that, the project also does a comparison between worldwide records and Brazilian records in onder to identify differences in the behavior.

# Tools
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Tableau

# Data Source 
- data: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks)

# Data Cleaning
The cleaning process consisted in scanning the raw data downloaded on Kaggle, eliminating the columns that would not be useful in the analysis, eliminating rows without any data and analyzing carefully the data in all columns that would be relevant for the analysis with the objective of fixing some data (e.g. removing extra spaces or non-numerical/non-alphabetical characters that should be there).

# Analysis

The analysis made were:
- Shark attacks grouped by sex
- Fatality of shark attacks
- Fatality of shark attacks grouped by the acitivity type (shark provoked, shark unprovoked, sea disaster or boating)
- Timeline of shark attacks
- Occurrences of shark attack around the world

# Results

All results and conclusions can be accessed on [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/profile/leonardo.prata.maciel#!/vizhome/Shark_attack/TheDangerofSharkAttacks)
